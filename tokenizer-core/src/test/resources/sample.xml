        <b><span>This review is from: </span><a>Arrested Development: Season Two (DVD)</a></b>
      </div>

Over the past few years there has been much talk about the supposed death of the sitcom on network television. And if those preparing to mourn the genre consider Friends or its ilk to be the standard-bearer, than perhaps they are right.<br/><br/>But maybe, just maybe, with Arrested Development we are seeing the future of the situation comedy... and if that's the case, things are looking up!<br/><br/>Arrested Development isn't your standard "set up a punch line, deliver punch-line, listen to the studio audience roar" show. In fact, rarely is there a set up or punchline, but rather keenly written and expertly delivered dialogue. And rather than the standard "Joey and Phoebe get stuck in an elevator while Rachel and Monica plan Thanksgiving dinner" storylines, Arrested lets each episode unfold in an intricate and intriguing manner with humor that ranges from subtle to sublime.<br/><br/>The basic premise? We're spending time with the Bluth family, who, to borrow a phrase, put the "fun" in dysfunctional. The characters range from maniacal (especially the Emmy-worthy turn by Jessica Walter as matriarch Lucille Bluth) to misguided (perhaps best exemplified by Will Arnett's desperate-for-attention-at-any-cost Gob). These aren't cookie-cutter cardboard characters as you'll find on other comedies. Each is a fascinating character study, with flaws and faults and quirks unlike those seen in other television households.<br/><br/>Best of all - and perhaps the main reason to purchase the DVD - the show is (gasp) laugh-out-loud funny and will be whether this is the first or one-hundred-and-first time you view the episodes.<br/><br/>Comedy, dead? Not as long as the Bluth family are around!
