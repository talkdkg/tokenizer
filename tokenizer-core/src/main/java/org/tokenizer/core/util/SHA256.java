 * Quote 1: It's perfectly fine. Accidental collision of MD5 is practically impossible (to get a 50% chance of collision
 * you'd have to hash 6 billion URLs per second, every second for 100 years). Quote 2: You still need to be aware that
 * deliberate MD5 hash collisions are easy to do. If this is going to be a problem you would be better off using SHA-1
 * or some other newer hash function that isn't as broken as MD5.
