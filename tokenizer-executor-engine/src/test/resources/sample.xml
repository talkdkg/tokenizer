    </div>

i can't believe I found this little thing. A stated, i paid only a buck 90 for this and It WORKS! It took almost 2 weeks to get here but it did come from China. I plugged it into my laptopa dn connected my old Droid 2 and it instantly started charging. Connected my old TracPhone and an older motorola and it worked! I have an old T-Mobile Samsung phone(not a smartphone) and I lost the charger for it years ago. I pulled out the old phone and connected it to the appropriate connector and again, IT WORKS! For the price, for what all it has done for me thus far, I'm happy that I paid only $1.90 for this thing. Now if any of my friends need their phones charged while hanging out at my house, I can easily take care of their charging needs. It does not have an iPhone 5 connection but i wasn't expecting one. I'm probably going to buy another one just to give to my dad.<br/>
    <br/>-----Don't think about and just buy it!<br/>
    <br/>-Oh, and I'm charging three phones at the same time right now. All from a single USB port from my laptop. Awesomeness...
